----- Static VS Dynamic Websites

A static website is a ready-file stored in a server with for example HTML,CSS,JS,images which will later be sent
when a request comes. There will be no backend code, the app won't be running. 

Dynamic websites on the other hand are built on the server each time a request happens. They have a db, the app is running, 
NodeJS will fetch data from the db, get a predefined template and then build each page based on the request.
The dynamic part has nothing to do with JS.

When the request happens the appropriate data is fetched and the proper template is loaded with HTML,CSS and JS. This process 
can be called server-side rendering. The dynamic means that the content might change based on the data in the db or because 
of the user's actions.

Dynamic websites and web apps can be used interchangeably because web apps can be seen as dynamic websites with functionalities.


----- Dynamic VS API Websites

API websites will have a db and a app that fetches data when a request happens very similar to dynamic websites. The difference is 
that API websites send only data as JSON to the browser and not a whole site.

The building of the website will happen when consuming the API, it can then render the data from a template. The website is built on 
the frontend instead of the backend and it's called client-side rendering.

----- One API, many consumers 

An API can be consumed by browsers, mobile apps, native apps making API websites more flexible.
