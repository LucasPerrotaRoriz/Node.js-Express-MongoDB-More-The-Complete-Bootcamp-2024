Q) How to make a server communicate with databases?

Q) What is a dynamic server and what is composed of?


----- Front-End and Back-End 

-- Frontend

The front end is responsible for creating the UI that will render on the browser using different technologies called stack.


-- Backend

A server is a PC connected to the internet. It will store files for example HTML,CSS and JS but also a HTTP server for requesting and delivering 
responses. The HTTP server is the one that communicates with the browser and create requests and responses, working as a bridge between the front 
and backend. 

Since the server can only serve static files to the browser with HTTP, it's called a simple server, useful for hosting websites.

If you want the server to talk with databases for example you will need a server that runs OR dynamic apps. This is a dynamic server composed 
of a HTTP server, files and the OR dynamic that communicate with each other.

When using a dynamic server you will also want to use a database to store data and be accessed by the app. In my case i will be using 
NodeJS as the dynamic server and MongoDB for the database.
