----- Node process and threads

When Node is in a computer, it means it's process is running there. A process is a instance of a program executing on the PC.

In the process Node will run on a single thread which can be see as a box that runs your code in the CPU.

When a program begins running: 

- first only top level code will be executed, meaning code outside of callbacks and functions. 
- The modules are required
- Callbacks are registered
- Event loop starts running

When there are too heavy tasks, they are executed in the thread pool which has 4 threads separated from the "main" thread.
The se tasks are usually something related to:
- File systems APIs
- Cryptography
- Compression
- DNS lookups

Which can block the main thread causing issues.
