Q) 

Q) Code:
- Log the arguments object
- Require module and log the wrapper
- Create a test module with a calculator class with add, multiply and divide methods
- Export the calculator
- Import the module and create a new instance
- Call a method
- Turn the class to a class expression
- Create another module and use the exports alternative 
- Require the module and use a method. Then use destructuring 
- Create another module that has a log and exports a method that logs a message
- Require the module and execute the function on the same line 3 times


Logging the arguments object you will be able to see the variables of the special wrapper function.

To use the module.exports method all you have to do is create a class and export it like modules.exports = Calculator.

The alternative is adding properties to the exports object.

On the caching module the log inside the module appears only once because the code was executed one time only. The other two 
are from cache.
