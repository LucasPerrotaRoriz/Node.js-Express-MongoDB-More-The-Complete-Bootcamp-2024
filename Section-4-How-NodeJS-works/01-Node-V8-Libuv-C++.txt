----- The NodeJS architecture behind the scenes

The Node runtime is composed of several dependencies the most important being V8 and Libuv. V8 in here makes sense since Node is a JS runtime based on V8.

V8 is responsible for converting JS to machine code. 
libuv is an open source library focused on async IO. It will give Node access to:
- Operating system
- file system
- networking and more

libuv also implements the event loop which handles executing callbacks and network IO while the thread pool is used for heavy work such as file access or
compression. 

libuv uses C++ and V8 uses a mix of JS and C++. So NodeJS runs on JS and C++.

NodeJS relies also on: http-parser for parsing http, c-ares for DNS request related things, OpenSSL for cryptography, zlib for compression.
