Q) How to create an event?

Q) Code
- Require event module 
- Create a new event instance 
- Emit an event called "newSale"
- Create two listeners for the event 
- Pass an argument to the event listener
- Create a class that inherits the emitter and then create new object
- Create a server and attach two listeners for request to them. Log and send a message
- Create another from close event 
- Listen for the server 
- 



To use events you must require the events module. To create an emitter just create a new instance.

Event emitters can emit events that can be subscribe/listen to and then react.

You can pass arguments to the event listener by passing them as additional arguments

If you have multiple listeners for the same event, they will execute synchronously.

If you were to use these pattern, you will need to create a new class that inherits from the EventEmitter. This is 
how core modules implement events by inheriting EventEmitter.

Be careful since you can't have another response for th same event. Only one response can be sent to a particular server.
