createServer create a server and fires the callback function everytime you there's a hit/request on the server. 
It will have access to the req and res objects.

You can send a response with res.end().

Use listen() for listening to requests. It takes a port which is a sub-address on a certain host, a host that if 
not specified will default to localhost and a optional callback function that runs when the server starts listening.

When you run the application the app keeps running because of the event loop. This makes sense since if it quit you could not
receive any requests. To quit do CTRL+C.
