Q) 

Q) Code:
- Add a route for /api
- Read the file data.json and parse the data. 
- Have status code 200, and content type for JSON
- Send data as response. Show data on url
- Have the read the sync and outside, parse the data 
- Send data on createServer

An API is a service that you can request data and get data back.

IN node the '.' refers to the current directory from which the node command is being run in the terminal.
All NodeJS script get access to __dirname which that is the directory that the node is being run. It's a good practice 
to use these.
The require is an exception, you can require your own modules and the '.' means the current directory and not the place the 
script is executed.

You can parse JSON data with parse that will transform data into JS object.

Having the readFile for /api inside createServer is not a efficient because everytime a request happens the file is read and the 
data is sent. It's much better to have file reading in the beginning and then send data every hit without reading 
all over again.

Since the top level code is only executed in the beginning theres no problem it being blocking. 

It's important to identify code that executes once and others who repeat.
