----- Synchronous VS Asynchronous code

Sync code can also be called blocking code since the next line needs to wait for the previous to execute. This can become a problem
when a slow operation is executed. An example is the file being read on folder 02.

To solve this you can use async code. The heavy work is done in the background, once it's finished the assigned
callback function will be executed to handle the result. This is advantageous since the rest of the code can keep
being executed.
