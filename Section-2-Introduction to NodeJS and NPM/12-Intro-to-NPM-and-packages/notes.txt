----- Question 

Q) Code:
- 

npm init to start.

There are two types of packages you can install simple and development dependencies. They are called like this because the code depends on them.

You can install a package with npm install, use --save-dev to install as dev dependencies, -g to install globally.

You can install globally or locally.

Install slugify, nodemon as dev.
