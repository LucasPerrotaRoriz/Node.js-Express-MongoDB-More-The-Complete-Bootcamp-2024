Q) How to exit the console?

Q) What can you do in the console?


Typing node on the console will open the Node RELP that means: Read, Eval, Print, Loop. This will allow you to use JS code for example
creating variables. You can exit this mode by .exit or CTRL+D.

Double tap Tab to see all global variables currently available in NodeJS. You can also do this for example "String." it will show the available
methods for String.

On terminal you can also do calculations and by using _ you will access the previous result. Example: 3*8 = 24, _+6 = 30.
