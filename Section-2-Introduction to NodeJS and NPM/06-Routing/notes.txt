Q) What the relation between the code,url routes and the file system?

Q) Code:
- Get the request url
- Have different response for different routes. /, /overview, /product
- Have a fallback and define status code, content type and header.
- Print response

Routing is different actions for different URLs

You can use the url module to analyze the url. You can access the request url by using "req.url".
The callback is executed twice because th browser makes a request for the site favicon the other 
is the current directory, in this case /. If it wore overview, it would print /overview.

For example: http://127.0.0.1:8000/overview.

You can also have data in url like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/id=123&abc=456

You can make use of if else to change the log and the page changes

If no fallback is provided and you access a page that does not exist, the page will keep on loading.

By using writeHead you can pass the status code, content type and a custom header.

A HTTP header is a piece of info about the response you're sending.
By defining the content type as text/html, you can then use a tag in the response.
You need to setup the headers and status code before the response.

The routes defined in the code and URL and the ones in the file system are not the same. You 
can't do /templates, unless you've set a route.
