----- Question 

Q) Code:
- Parse the url and get query and pathname.
- Have the product path have status code and content type
- Get the appropriate data 
- Replace product
- Make back button work

To parse the url you must use the parse() from the url module, that receives a request url and a boolean value for parsing 
the query into an object.
